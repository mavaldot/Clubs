This program was developed and tested on the Windows 10 operating system 

The MockGenerator class generates random data and uses it to create 10000 owners and between 10000 and 200000 pets on each club. The data has already been created and is saved on the res folder.

The program should take less than a minute to load. If the program is too slow delete the files on the res folder and try again.
